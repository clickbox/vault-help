## How Visual Navigation Works

This is how visual navigation works, and for some reason this description requires a table with an image inside it:

<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Status</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>cell1 data</td>
    <td>cell2 data</td>
  </tr>

<tr>
    <td>cell1 data</td>
    <td>cell2 data</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
